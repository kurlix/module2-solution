					<strong><a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a></strong> is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write </p>
					<p><strong><a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/javascript-frameworks/" target="_blank">L</a></strong>: This tiny library transforms the whole web into a fully interactive and 	entertaining experience, with a reported whopping 70%+ of the World’s leading 		websites having something to do with jQuery. jQuery plugins and widgets are amongst the most searched components within the front-end developer </p>
					<p>Companies like WordPress, Google, IBM and many others rely on jQuery to provide a one of a kind web browsing experience to its own staff and of course the vast ocean of internet users. jQuery is also fully compilant with mobile devices, and has a separate jQuery Mobile library to take care of all things mobile.

					<p>
					<strong><a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a></strong>  lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
					</p>
					<p>AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.
					</p>
					<p><strong><a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/javascript-frameworks/" target="_blank">L</a></strong>: Google’s ever-popular web development framework Angular has exploded with popularity in recent years, and continues to provide a solid base foundation for developers who are working strictly with the latest industry standards and abilities. Angular.js in itself provides a set of modern development and design features for rapid application development, and Google has gone as far as creating a separate part of the site that offers the Material Design specification to help you build apps that stay in touch with the most modern approaches there are.

					<h2>Backbone</h2>

				<div class="box_content">
					<p>
					<strong><a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a></strong> gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong><a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/javascript-frameworks/" target="_blank">L</a></strong>: Building elegant one-page and single-page applications with the most traditional web development libraries can turn your code base into a full spaghetti dinner if you’re not paying attention to your code’s structure and coalition. Backbone is built with the idea in mind that all server-side functions should flow through an API, minimizing the amount of code that needs to be composed in order to acheive the same complex functionality of more sophisticated web <br>
					Backbone is amongst some of the most popular web development frameworks for JavaScript developers, and partly for two reasons — it’s easy to understand usability modules, as well as the very straightforward learning curve.
